          <h1>Harold Cabalic</h1>
          <sub>Software Engineer, Front End</sub>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Harold and I am a Software Engineer with experience in front-end since 2007. 
    I joined Pinterest in my most recent role from 2020-2023 as a backend Software Engineer working in distributed systems, while still having the opportunity to contribute on special internal front-end projects. For my next role, I'm looking to step up to Senior level in front-end. I'm highly confident in my ability to take a design and implement it in re-usable & efficient code, and I've been a reliable contributor to organizations throughout my career.

          <p>A collection of mini-projects that I work on when I have time, mostly as a way to try out new technologies & keep my front-end skills fresh.</p>

          <h2>Selected Works</h2>
          <p>Just a few of the full website builds throughout my career in which I was the primary, and often times only, developer. These projects spanned a variety of tech stacks.</p>

              <img src="./images/website-squaretrade-v2.png" alt="squaretrade.com" />
              <p>
                A protection plan company for which I worked for from 2011-2017. As their first front-end software engineer, I had contributed to a number of website redesigns. Additionally, I had developed SquareTrade's first mobile website (m.squaretrade.com) as well as a handful of their international subdomains (AT, DK, FI).

              <p>
                The first project I built over a two-week period at my first agency job in San Francisco, which involved several late nights, long weekends, and unlimited pizza. WCG (WeissComm Group) is now <a href="https://www.realchemistry.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Real Chemistry</a>.

              <p>
                One of the first significant builds that I had been assigned very early in my career - restaurant & recipe website for renowned chef Wolfgang Puck. Also developed microsite for Puck's line of soups, wolfgangpucksoups.com.

              <p>
                A full website build that is particularly memorable for me mostly because of how intricate its design was and how much critical thinking that was required to implement the main dropdown menu (at the time we had implemented the dropdown using sprites).

              <p>
                Handmade aluminum bicycle framebuilder based in San Francisco, CA. I approached Andrew Low with the hopes of contributing in any way to the SF bicycle scene, and do something for my growing love of cycling. Originally a static website, this was re-implemented using Drupal CMS.
