          <h1>Harold Cabalic</h1>
          <sub>Software Engineer</sub>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Harold and I am a Software Engineer with experience in front-end since 2007. 
    I joined Pinterest in my most recent role from 2020-2023 as a backend Software Engineer working in distributed systems, while still having the opportunity to contribute on special internal front-end projects. For my next role, I'm looking to step up to Senior level in front-end. I'm highly confident in my ability to take a design and implement it in re-usable & efficient code, and I've been a reliable contributor to organizations throughout my career.

          <h2>Selected Works</h2>
          <p>A collection of full website builds in which I was the primary, and often times sole developer. These projects spanned a variety of tech stacks.</p>

              <img src="./images/website-squaretrade-v2.png" alt="squaretrade.com" />
              <p>
                A third-party protection plan company for which I worked for from 2011-2017. As their first front-end software engineer, I had contributed heavily to full website redesigns. This snapshot is an iPhone product page as part of SquareTrade's rebrand. Additionally, I had developed SquareTrade's first mobile website (m.squaretrade.com) as well as a handful of their international subdomains (AT, DK, FI).

              <p>

              <p>
                A full website build that is memorable for me mostly because of how intricate its design was and how much attention to detail that was needed just for the main dropdown menu.
