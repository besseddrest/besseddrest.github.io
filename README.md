# Intro
Hi, my name is Harold and I am a Software Engineer with experience in front-end since 2007. 
I joined Pinterest in my most recent role from 2020-2023 as a backend Software Engineer working in distributed systems, while still getting the opportunity to contribute on special internal front-end projects. For my next role, I'm looking to step up to Senior level in front-end. I'm highly confident in my ability to take a design and implement it in re-usable & efficient code, and I've been a reliable contributor to organizations throughout my career.

## Projects
Below are a handful of projects that I've worked on throughout the years. Note that some of these are no longer in production.
